# ez-coder README

This is the README for your extension "ez-coder". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Setup Requirements

This extension requires a personal API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) to function.

2.  **Set the API Key in VS Code**:
    * Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
    * Type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)" and select it.
    * Add the following line to your `settings.json` file, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key:
        ```json
        "ez-coder.openRouterApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
3.  **Save** the settings file. The extension is now ready to use.
